# Password Generator Starter Code

In this Module, we learned how to use JavaScript. I designed a series of prompts to create a secure password that could include capitalization, special characters, numbers, and is in between 8 and 128 characters. When all prompts were answered the page gives you a secure password to use. The page has a clean and polished UI, and is visually appealing. The code I used was refactored to be easy to read and understand.
